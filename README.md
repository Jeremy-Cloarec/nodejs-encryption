# Node.js Encryption

This project demonstrates basic encryption and decryption techniques using Node.js and the crypto module. 

The encryption method is 256-bit AES encryption, which is a symmetric encryption algorithm. This means that the same key is used for both encryption and decryption.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your machine

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nodejs-encryption.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd nodejs-encryption
    ```
3. Install the dependencies:
    ```sh
    yarn install
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the encryption script:
    ```sh
    yarn dev
    ```
2. Go to http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

3. Enter the text you want to encrypt and click the "Encrypt" button.
